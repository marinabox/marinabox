Computer User's thought: I'm currently viewing the Apple MacBook Pro purchase page. Let me describe it in detail:

At the top of the page is the standard Apple navigation bar with various product categories including Store, Mac, iPad, iPhone, Watch, Vision, AirPods, TV & Home, Entertainment, Accessories, and Support, along with the Apple logo and search/cart icons.

The main content begins with a large heading "Choose your new MacBook Pro." Below this is a help section that reads "Have questions about buying a Mac?" with a link to "Chat with a Mac Specialist."

The page offers two main size options:
- 14-inch (currently selected)
- 16-inch

There's a "Filter by chip" section with four options:
- All chips (selected)
- M4
- M4 Pro
- M4 Max

Below this are three MacBook Pro configurations displayed side by side, all in Space Black color (with a silver option available). Each model shows:

1. First Model:
- M4 chip
- 10-Core CPU
- 10-Core GPU
- 16GB Unified Memory
- 512GB SSD Storage
- 16-core Neural Engine
- 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display
- Three Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI port, SDXC card slot, headphone jack, MagSafe 3 port
- Magic Keyboard with Touch ID
- Force Touch trackpad
- 70W USB-C Power Adapter

2. Second Model:
- Similar specs but with 1TB SSD Storage

3. Third Model:
- Similar specs but with 24GB Unified Memory and 1TB SSD Storage

All models are marked as "New" and feature the same connectivity options and accessories. The page has a clean, white background with clear product images showing the MacBook Pro in Space Black from a side view, highlighting its slim profile.

The layout is well-organized and makes it easy to compare the different configurations side by side. Each model shows the exact same angle of the MacBook Pro, making it easy to maintain consistency while browsing different options.
