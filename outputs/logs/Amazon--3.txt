The page displays three main features, presented in boxes with icons:

- Heading: "Stronger security"
- Description: "Protect your passwords against phishing"

3. Right box:

At the bottom of the page, there are two buttons:
- A "Don't sign in" button (appears to be in white/outlined style)
- A "Sign in" button (appears to be in solid blue)

The page has a clean, minimal design with a white background and uses Google's standard design language.
