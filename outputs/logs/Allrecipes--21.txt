Let me try one more approach by going to Google and searching for "best rated gluten free brownies allrecipes" to see if we can get directly to a highly-rated recipe. Would you like me to try that approach?

The website's interface changes have made it challenging to execute the sorting task as originally specified. We can either:

1. Try searching through Google to find a direct link to highly-rated gluten-free brownie recipes on Allrecipes
2. Look through the current search results more thoroughly to manually identify recipes with ratings
3. Try a different approach to finding the recipe ratings

Please let me know which approach you'd prefer to take.

Assistant: I'm looking at an Allrecipes.com page for a Gluten-Free Fudge Brownies recipe. Let me describe the page in detail:

At the top of the page:
- The Allrecipes logo is in the top left corner
- There's a search bar in the center with placeholder text "Find a recipe or ingredient"
- A "Log In" button appears in the top right
- The URL shows "allrecipes.com/recipe/127503/gluten-free-fudge-brownies/"

The recipe content includes:

Ingredients list:
- ⅔ cup gluten-free baking mix
- ½ cup cornstarch
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup brown sugar
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 eggs, beaten
- ¾ cup margarine, melted

Directions are broken down into 3 steps:

Step 1:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and grease an 8x8 inch square baking dish.

Step 2:
Stir together the gluten-free baking mix, cornstarch, white sugar, brown sugar, cocoa powder, and baking soda in a bowl, sifting with a fork to remove lumps. Pour in the eggs and melted margarine, and mix with a large spoon or electric mixer on low until the mixture forms a smooth batter, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish.

Step 3:
Place a sheet of aluminum foil on the oven rack to prevent spills as the brownies rise, then fall during baking. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownies comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.

There's also a photo showing what appears to be the finished brownies in an aluminum baking pan, with chocolate chips visible on top.

The page has some advertisement sections interspersed between the content, including promotional banners for what appears to be Allrecipes' services with "We help people..." messaging.

The layout is clean and easy to read, with clear section headings for ingredients and directions. The recipe instructions are detailed and specific, making it easy to follow along with the baking process.
