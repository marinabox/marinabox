The page displays three main features with their respective icons and descriptions:

1. All your devices

- Description: "Easily pick up where you left off"

2. Stronger security
- Represented by a shield icon
- Description: "Protect your passwords against phishing"

3. Back up data
- Represented by a cloud icon
- Description: "Save your bookmarks, passwords and more with sync"

At the bottom of the page, there are two buttons:

The page is focused on encouraging users to sign in to Chromium by highlighting the three main benefits of doing so: device synchronization, enhanced security, and data backup. Each benefit is presented in its own card-like section with a distinctive icon and clear explanation of the feature's value proposition.
