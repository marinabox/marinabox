At the top of the page, there's the Chromium logo (the blue circular icon). Below that is the main heading "Sign in to Chromium" followed by a subheading "Get additional features".

The page displays three main features presented in separate boxes:

1. All your devices

- Description: "Easily pick up where you left off"

2. Stronger security
- Represented by a shield icon
- Description: "Protect your passwords against phishing"

3. Back up data
- Represented by a cloud icon
- Description: "Save your bookmarks, passwords and more with sync"

At the bottom of the page, there are two buttons:
- "Don't sign in" (in white/outlined style)
- "Sign in" (in blue)
