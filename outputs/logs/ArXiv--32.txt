Title: "Structured pathways in the turbulence organizing recent oil spill events in the Eastern Mediterranean"

Authors: Guillermo García-Sanchez, Ana M. Mancho, Antonio G. Ramos, Josep Coca, Stephen Wiggins

Submission Date: [Submitted on 23 Dec 2024]

Abstract Summary: 
The paper addresses the challenge of understanding how oil spills move in chaotic ocean currents. The researchers study recent oil spill events that affected the Mediterranean coast of Middle Eastern countries, focusing on using Lagrangian Coherent Structures to find patterns in ocean chaos. They combined satellite observations with computational modeling to track and understand how the oil spills spread, successfully developing methods to determine both the original location of spills and their evolution over time. Their approach shows promise in helping to anticipate and understand the movement of oil spills in chaotic ocean environments.

The paper is cross-listed in multiple categories including Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD) and Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn), and was published in Scientific Reports 12, 3662 (2022).

### **Title:**
**Structured pathways in the turbulence organizing recent oil spill events in the Eastern Mediterranean**

### **Authors:**
Guillermo García-Sanchez, Ana M. Mancho, Antonio G. Ramos, Josep Coca, Stephen Wiggins

### **Submission Date:**
Submitted on **23 Dec 2024**

### **Abstract Summary:**

This paper addresses the complex challenge of understanding the dispersion of oil spills in the chaotic and turbulent flows of the ocean, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The authors examine recent oil spill incidents that have impacted the coastlines of Middle Eastern countries. By utilizing **Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS)**, they identify and analyze the structured pathways within the ocean's turbulence that govern the movement of oil spills.

Their methodology combines satellite observations with computational modeling to track and predict the evolution of these spills. The study successfully determines both the origin locations and the dispersion patterns over time. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using LCS to anticipate the transport of pollutants in chaotic ocean environments, which is crucial for environmental monitoring and response strategies.
