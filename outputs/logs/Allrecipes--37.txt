At the top of the page, there's the Chromium logo (the blue circular icon). Below it is the main heading "Sign in to Chromium" followed by a subheading "Get additional features".

The page displays three main features that you can get by signing in:

1. "All your devices"
- Represented by a computer/device icon
- Description: "Easily pick up where you left off"

2. "Stronger security"
- Represented by a shield icon
- Description: "Protect your passwords against phishing"

3. "Back up data"
- Represented by a cloud icon
- Description: "Save your bookmarks, passwords and more with sync"

At the bottom of the page, there are two buttons:
