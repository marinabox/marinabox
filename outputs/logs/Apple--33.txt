   - Represented by a computer/device icon
   - Description: "Easily pick up where you left off"

2. "Stronger security"
   - Represented by a shield icon
   - Description: "Protect your passwords against phishing"

3. "Back up data"

- A "Sign in" button (in blue, more prominent)

The page has a clean, minimalist design with a white background and uses Google's typical Material Design elements. Various decorative elements appear around the edges of the page, including blue circles on the left, a coral/red arrow, and some geometric shapes on the right side including a yellow hexagon and green circles.
