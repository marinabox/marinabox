Would you like me to:
1. Try navigating to the main arXiv site (arxiv.org) first to see if there's a link to their store?
2. Try a different URL format for the store?
3. Search for "arXiv merchandise" or "arXiv store" in a search engine?

Assistant: I'm looking at the arXiv official store page on Bonfire.com. Here's a detailed description of what I see:

At the top of the page:
- The browser shows "bonfire.com/store/arxiv-official/"
- There's a Bonfire logo in the center of the header
- Navigation options include "MENU" on the left and "Log in" and Cart icons on the right

The main content shows several arXiv-branded merchandise items:

1. Apparel Section:
- Premium Unisex Tee ($28.49) - Available in white and gray
- Premium Long Sleeve Tee ($33.49) - Available in white
- Midweight Pullover Hoodie ($45.49) - Available in gray and white

2. Mugs Section:
- Regular Coffee Mug ($19.99)
- Large Coffee Mug ($22.49)
Both mugs feature the arXiv logo in black and red

3. "arXiv is Open Science" Collection:
- Shows the same apparel items with a different design that includes the arXiv logo and "Supporting Open Scientific Communication" text

On the left sidebar:
- arXiv logo
- "ABOUT" section describing arXiv as "an open research sharing platform reinventing scientific communications"
- A Twitter/X icon
- Link to www.arxiv.org

The page appears to be a merchandise store for arXiv, offering various branded items to support the open science platform. The design is clean and professional, with items displayed on a white background and clear pricing information.

The page continues below with what appears to be more merchandise options, though I'd need to scroll further to see the complete collection. Would you like me to scroll down more to see what else is available?
