Assistant: Let me take a screenshot first to see what's currently displayed on the screen.
Tool use: computer with input {'action': 'screenshot'}

1. At the top of the page, there's the Chromium browser logo (the blue circular icon)
2. The main heading reads "Sign in to Chromium"
3. Below that is a subheading that says "Get additional features"

The page displays three main features that you can get by signing in:

1. "All your devices"
   - With an icon showing multiple devices
   - Description: "Easily pick up where you left off"

2. "Stronger security"
   - With a shield icon
   - Description: "Protect your passwords against phishing"

3. "Back up data"
   - With a cloud icon
   - Description: "Save your bookmarks, passwords and more with sync"

At the bottom of the page, there are two buttons:
- A "Don't sign in" button (in white/outline style)

The page is a simple, clean sign-in page that focuses on presenting the three main benefits of signing into Chromium: device synchronization, security features, and data backup capabilities. The page uses a minimal color scheme with blue as the primary accent color, and the layout is centered and well-organized with clear iconography to illustrate each feature.

The page appears to be designed to give users a clear choice between signing in to access additional features or continuing without signing in, with the associated benefits clearly laid out for users to make an informed decision.

Tool use: computer with input {'action': 'screenshot'}
Assistant: I apologize, but I don't see a "Filter by chip" section or an "M4 Pro" option on the current page. It appears we're looking at the Mac Mini configurations, but they all show M4 chips with 10-core GPUs. This might be because:

1. We may not be on the correct configuration page yet
2. The M4 Pro option might not be available for the Mac Mini (as of January 2025)

Looking at the current page, all models shown have:
- M4 chip (not M4 Pro)
- 10-Core CPU
- 10-Core GPU
- 16-core Neural Engine

Would you like me to:
1. Look for a "Filter by chip" option by scrolling through the page?
2. Check if we need to navigate to a different page first?

SAMS THOUGHT:  **Correction to Step 5:**

It seems that the "Filter by chip" option and the "M4 Pro" configurations are not available for the Mac mini on the current page. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

**Step 5:** Let's explore the highest available configuration to see if we can customize the Mac mini with a GPU larger than 16-core.

- **Click on the "Select" button** under the **highest-priced Mac mini model** displayed on the page (the one priced at **$999.00** with **24GB Unified Memory** and **512GB SSD Storage**).

**Step 6:** On the customization page, look for options to upgrade the GPU:

- **Scroll down** to the section where you can configure the processor and GPU options.
- **Check if there are any options** to select a GPU with more than **16 cores**.

**Step 7:** Review the available GPU configurations:

- If there is an option to upgrade to a GPU larger than 16-core, **select that option**.
- If no such option exists, then **note that the Mac mini cannot be configured with a GPU larger than 16-core**.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available configurations on the Apple website, the **Mac mini cannot be configured with a GPU larger than 16-core**. The highest GPU option for the Mac mini is a 16-core GPU.

**Task Complete.**
