3. **Exclude Accessories:**
   - Under the **"Product Type"** or **"Features"** section, check for options to exclude **"Accessories"**, **"Grids"**, or **"Sink Protectors"**.
   - If there's an option like **"Kitchen Sinks"** without subcategories like **"Sink Accessories"**, select it to narrow down the results.

4. **Sort the Results:**
   - At the top-right of the search results, find the **"Sort by"** dropdown menu.
   - Select **"Price: Low to High"** to display the cheapest items first.

5. **Review the Results:**
