SAMS THOUGHT:  The integral has been computed. According to the results displayed by Wolfram Alpha, the value of the integral \(\int_{0}^{5} 3e^{2x} \, dx\) is:

\[
\frac{3}{2} \left( e^{10} - 1 \right)
\]

Calculating the numerical value:

\[
\frac{3}{2} \left( e^{10} - 1 \right) \approx \frac{3}{2} \left( 22026.4658 - 1 \right) \approx \frac{3}{2} \times 22025.4658 \approx 33,038.1987
\]

So, the approximate value of the integral is **33,038.2**.

The task is complete.
