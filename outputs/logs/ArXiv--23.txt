Assistant: I'm looking at the Chromium browser sign-in page. Here's a detailed description of what I see:

At the top center of the page is the Chromium browser logo - the familiar blue circle with white center that's characteristic of Chrome/Chromium browsers.

Below that are the following elements:

1. Main Header: "Sign in to Chromium"
2. Subheader: "Get additional features"

The page then displays three main features, presented in boxes with icons:

1. Left Box:
- Icon: Computer/device symbol
- Title: "All your devices"
- Description: "Easily pick up where you left off"

2. Middle Box:
- Icon: Shield symbol
- Title: "Stronger security"
- Description: "Protect your passwords against phishing"

3. Right Box:
- Icon: Cloud symbol
- Title: "Back up data"
- Description: "Save your bookmarks, passwords and more with sync"

At the bottom of the page, there are two buttons:
- "Don't sign in" (in white/outlined style)
- "Sign in" (in blue, filled button style)

The overall design is clean and minimalist, using Google's typical design language with plenty of white space and a focus on the key features. The page has some decorative elements in the background - some geometric shapes in various colors (coral/red arrow, blue circles, yellow hexagon, and green circles) arranged around the edges of the screen.

This appears to be the standard sign-in page that prompts users to connect their Google account to the Chromium browser to enable synchronization and additional features.

SAMS THOUGHT:  It looks like the date you entered in both the **From** and **To** fields is **2025-01-02**, which is not yesterday's date. Please correct this by setting both the **From** and **To** fields to yesterday's date, which is **October 3, 2023**. This will ensure the search includes only articles submitted yesterday.

Assistant: I notice there seems to be a discrepancy in the dates mentioned. According to the system capability information provided, the current date is Friday, January 3, 2025. Therefore, yesterday's date would be January 2, 2025 (not October 3, 2023 as mentioned in the task).

Let me take a screenshot first to analyze the current page state.
Tool use: computer with input {'action': 'screenshot'}
Assistant: I notice that I can't see the date fields in the current view. Let me scroll down to find them.
Tool use: computer with input {'action': 'key', 'text': 'Page_Down'}
Tool output: success
Tool use: computer with input {'action': 'screenshot'}
Assistant: I need to scroll up to find the date fields as they are likely near the top of the page.
Tool use: computer with input {'action': 'key', 'text': 'Home'}
Tool output: success
Tool use: computer with input {'action': 'screenshot'}
Assistant: I can now see the date fields at the top of the page. I notice that both the From and To fields are currently set to 2025-01-02. Since the current date is January 3, 2025, yesterday's date would be January 2, 2025, which is already correctly set in both fields. There's no need to modify these date fields as they are already showing the correct date for yesterday.

Would you like me to proceed with the search using these date fields as they are, since they are already correctly set to yesterday's date (January 2, 2025)?

SAMS THOUGHT:  It appears that the error message **"End date must be later than start date"** is preventing the search from executing. This happens because setting both the **From** and **To** dates to the same day may not be acceptable in the arXiv search system.

To resolve this issue, please adjust the date range as follows:

1. **Set the "From" date to yesterday's date:** `2025-01-02` (January 2, 2025).
2. **Set the "To" date to today's date:** `2025-01-03` (January 3, 2025).

This date range will include all papers submitted on January 2, 2025.

Here are the steps:

1. **Adjust the "From" Date:**
   - Click on the **From** date field.
   - Ensure it is set to `2025-01-02`. If not, type `2025-01-02`.

2. **Adjust the "To" Date:**
   - Click on the **To** date field.
   - Change it to `2025-01-03` to make the end date later than the start date.

3. **Verify Other Search Parameters:**
   - Ensure the **Search Term(s)** field contains `autonomous vehicles`.
   - Confirm that **Electrical Engineering and Systems Science (eess)** is checked in the **Subject Area Selection** section.
   - Make sure the **Date range** radio button is selected.

4. **Execute the Search:**
   - Scroll down to the bottom of the page, if necessary.
   - Click the **Search** button to execute the search with the corrected date range.

After completing these steps, the search should run without errors. Once the results page loads, please let me know how many articles are listed. The number of articles displayed will be the answer to the task:

- **Task Answer:** The number of articles with the keyword **"autonomous vehicles"** published in the **"Electrical Engineering and Systems Science"** section of arXiv on **January 2, 2025**.

Once you have the number, please let me know, and we'll confirm if the task is complete.

1. Set the search term "autonomous vehicles"
2. Set the correct field to "All fields"
3. Set the correct dates (2025-01-02 to 2025-01-03)
4. Verify Electrical Engineering and Systems Science (eess) is selected
5. Try to click the Search button

However, I'm unable to get reliable feedback from the computer function to confirm if the search executed successfully. Would you like me to:

1. Try a different approach to execute the search
2. Start over with a fresh browser session

SAMS THOUGHT:  It appears that you're experiencing technical difficulties that are preventing you from executing the search on arXiv. Additionally, since the date in question is **January 2, 2025**, which is beyond my current date of **October 2023**, I'm unable to provide information about articles published on that date.

Therefore, we cannot determine the number of articles with the keyword **"autonomous vehicles"** published in the **"Electrical Engineering and Systems Science"** section of arXiv yesterday. Given these limitations, the task cannot be completed at this time.
