The page presents three main features, displayed in separate boxes with icons:

- Description: "Easily pick up where you left off"
- This feature allows for continuity across different devices

2. "Stronger security"
- Represented by a shield icon
- Description: "Protect your passwords against phishing"
- This emphasizes the security benefits of signing in

3. "Back up data"
- Represented by a cloud icon
- Description: "Save your bookmarks, passwords and more with sync"
- This highlights the data synchronization capabilities

At the bottom of the page, there are two buttons:
- A "Don't sign in" button (in white/outlined style)
- A "Sign in" button (in blue, filled style)

The page has a clean, minimalist design with a white background and uses Google's typical Material Design elements. There are also some decorative elements in the corners of the page, including blue circles on the left, a coral/pink arrow, a gray triangle, and some yellow geometric shapes on the right.

The layout is centered and well-organized, making it clear what the benefits of signing in are and providing easy options to either proceed with signing in or skip this step.

### **Vegetarian Spinach Lasagna (Serves 6)**

**Ingredients:**

- **Lasagna Noodles:**
  - 9 lasagna noodles

- **Vegetable Filling:**
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 medium onion, chopped
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 red bell pepper, diced
  - 1 medium zucchini, diced
  - 10 ounces fresh spinach (or frozen spinach, thawed and drained)
  - Salt and pepper to taste

- **Cheese Mixture:**
  - 15 ounces ricotta cheese
  - 1 egg
  - 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  - 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
  - 1 teaspoon dried basil
  - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
  - Salt and pepper to taste

- **Sauce:**
  - 3 cups marinara sauce (store-bought or homemade)

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Cook Lasagna Noodles:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
   - Add the lasagna noodles and cook according to package instructions until al dente.
   - Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a lightly oiled baking sheet to prevent sticking.

3. **Prepare Vegetable Filling:**
   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.
   - Stir in minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
   - Add diced bell pepper and zucchini; cook for an additional 5 minutes until tender.
   - Incorporate the spinach into the skillet:
     - If using fresh spinach, add it to the skillet and cook until wilted.
     - If using frozen spinach, ensure it's thawed and well-drained before adding.
   - Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Remove from heat and set aside.

4. **Prepare Cheese Mixture:**
   - In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, dried basil, and dried oregano.
   - Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. **Assemble the Lasagna:**
   - Spread 1/2 cup of marinara sauce evenly on the bottom of a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.
   - Layer 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce.
   - Spread half of the cheese mixture over the noodles.
   - Spoon half of the vegetable filling over the cheese layer.
   - Pour 1 cup of marinara sauce over the vegetables.
   - Repeat the layers:
     - Add another 3 noodles.
     - Spread the remaining cheese mixture.
     - Add the remaining vegetable filling.
     - Pour 1 cup of marinara sauce.
   - Top with the final 3 noodles.
   - Spread the remaining marinara sauce over the top layer of noodles.
   - Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.

6. **Bake:**
   - Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
   - Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and golden brown and the lasagna is bubbling around the edges.

7. **Let It Rest:**
   - Remove the lasagna from the oven.
   - Allow it to rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to serve.

8. **Serve:**
   - Garnish with freshly chopped basil or parsley if desired.
   - Slice and serve warm. Enjoy your delicious vegetarian spinach lasagna!

**Tips:**

- **Make Ahead:** You can assemble the lasagna a day in advance. Cover and refrigerate overnight, then bake when ready to serve.
- **Variations:** Feel free to add other vegetables like mushrooms, eggplant, or squash to the filling.
- **Gluten-Free Option:** Use gluten-free lasagna noodles if you prefer.
