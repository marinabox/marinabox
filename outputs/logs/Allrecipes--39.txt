- **Protein:** 4g

*Note: Nutrition information is approximate and may vary based on ingredient brands and measurements.*

### **How to Store the Sushi Rolls:**

To keep your sushi rolls fresh:

1. **Wrap Tightly:** Cover each sushi roll tightly with plastic wrap to prevent exposure to air, which can dry out the rice and nori.
2. **Use an Airtight Container:** Place the wrapped rolls in an airtight container to further protect them from moisture loss and odors from other foods in the refrigerator.
3. **Refrigerate Promptly:** Store the sushi rolls in the refrigerator at or below 40°F (4°C) to keep them safe from bacterial growth.
4. **Consume Soon:** For the best taste and safety, it's recommended to eat the stored sushi rolls within **24 hours**. The quality of sushi diminishes quickly, especially when it contains ingredients like avocado and crabmeat.
5. **Avoid Freezing:** Do not freeze sushi rolls, as freezing can alter the texture of the rice and other ingredients, making them less palatable when thawed.
