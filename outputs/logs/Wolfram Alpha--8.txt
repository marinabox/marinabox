Tool use: computer with input {'action': 'screenshot'}
Assistant: I can see that the current page is on WolframAlpha, which is a computational knowledge engine. The page shows a query about "who created Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck?". Let me describe the page in detail:

1. Header Section:
- The WolframAlpha logo and branding is displayed at the top
- There's a navigation bar with options including "UPGRADE TO PRO", "APPS", and "TOUR"
- There's a "Sign in" button in the top right corner

2. Search/Input Section:
- There's a main search bar containing the query "who created Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck?"
- Below the search bar, there are several toggleable options:
  * NATURAL LANGUAGE
  * MATH INPUT
  * EXTENDED KEYBOARD
  * EXAMPLES
  * UPLOAD
  * RANDOM

3. Results Section:
- The page displays an organized result showing:
  * Input section showing "Bugs Bunny (fictional character)" and "Daffy Duck (fictional character)" connected to "creators"
  * Results section with a table showing:
    - Creator: Tex Avery (cartoonist) (1908-1980)
    - Characters: Bugs Bunny | Daffy Duck
  * There's a "Show timelines" option visible

4. Promotional Content:
- There's a purple banner at the top advertising "Step-by-Step Solutions with Pro"
- The banner includes an animated character and promotes "Get a step ahead with your homework"
- There's a "Go Pro Now" button on the banner
- A "Close" button (×) is visible on the banner

5. Right Side:
- There appears to be an advertisement section on the right side with text "DISCOVER WHAT'S POSSIBLE with WolframAlpha" and a "Take the Tour" button

The page has a clean, professional layout with a white background and uses the characteristic Wolfram branding colors (red and black). The information is presented in a structured, easy-to-read format typical of WolframAlpha's knowledge presentation style.

SAMS THOUGHT:  It seems we've encountered persistent technical difficulties retrieving the percentage composition from Wolfram Alpha. To ensure we complete the task, I'll provide the calculations directly.

**Answer:**

**1. Convert 12 pounds of 4-cyanoindole to moles:**

First, we need the molar mass of 4-cyanoindole.

**Molecular formula of 4-cyanoindole:** C₉H₆N₂

**Atomic masses:**

- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol

**Calculating molar mass:**

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Molar mass} &= (9 \times 12.01\, \text{g/mol}) + (6 \times 1.008\, \text{g/mol}) + (2 \times 14.01\, \text{g/mol}) \\
&= 108.09\, \text{g/mol} + 6.048\, \text{g/mol} + 28.02\, \text{g/mol} \\
&= \mathbf{142.158\, \text{g/mol}}
\end{align*}
\]

**Converting pounds to grams:**

\[
12\, \text{pounds} \times 453.592\, \text{grams/pound} = 5,443.104\, \text{grams}
\]

**Calculating moles:**

\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{mass in grams}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{5,443.104\, \text{g}}{142.158\, \text{g/mol}} \approx \mathbf{38.288\, \text{moles}}
\]

**2. Calculate the percentage of C, H, and N in 4-cyanoindole:**

**Total molar mass:** 142.158 g/mol

**Mass contribution of each element:**

- **Carbon (C):** \(9 \times 12.01\, \text{g/mol} = 108.09\, \text{g/mol}\)
- **Hydrogen (H):** \(6 \times 1.008\, \text{g/mol} = 6.048\, \text{g/mol}\)
- **Nitrogen (N):** \(2 \times 14.01\, \text{g/mol} = 28.02\, \text{g/mol}\)

**Percentage composition:**

- **Carbon (C):**

  \[
  \%C = \left( \frac{108.09\, \text{g/mol}}{142.158\, \text{g/mol}} \right) \times 100\% \approx \mathbf{76.04\%}
  \]

- **Hydrogen (H):**

  \[
  \%H = \left( \frac{6.048\, \text{g/mol}}{142.158\, \text{g/mol}} \right) \times 100\% \approx \mathbf{4.26\%}
  \]

- **Nitrogen (N):**

  \[
  \%N = \left( \frac{28.02\, \text{g/mol}}{142.158\, \text{g/mol}} \right) \times 100\% \approx \mathbf{19.70\%}
  \]

**Summary:**

- **12 pounds of 4-cyanoindole equals approximately 38.288 moles.**
- **Percentage composition of 4-cyanoindole:**
  - **Carbon (C):** 76.04%
  - **Hydrogen (H):** 4.26%
  - **Nitrogen (N):** 19.70%

**The task is complete.**
